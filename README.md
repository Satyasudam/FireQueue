# FireQueue
A custom Linux firewall system written in c integrating iptables, libpcap and NFQUEUE (libnetfilter_queue)
Supports Dual Modes:

- **Simulation** (sniff-only via `libpcap`)
- **Enforcement** (active filtering via `NFQUEUE`)

Includes modular rule matching, NAT and redirection support, and a CLI interface for managing rules. Designed for learning, testing, and demonstrating packet-level filtering and traffic control in Linux using raw socket-level access and Netfilter hooks.

## ⚙️ Features

- ✅ **IPv4 & IPv6 support**  
- ✅ **NFQUEUE integration** for enforcement mode  
- ✅ **libpcap-based passive mode**  
- ✅ **CLI-based rule management** (add/delete/enable/disable/order)
- ✅ **Persistent rule config**  
- ✅ **Basic traffic logging**

---

## 📦 Dependencies

- `libpcap-dev`  
- `libnetfilter-queue-dev`  
- `iptables`, `ip6tables`

Install via:

```bash
sudo apt install libpcap-dev libnetfilter-queue-dev iptables iproute2
```

🚀 Usage
Run in Enforcement Mode (NFQUEUE-based)
```bash
sudo ./run_enforce.sh
```

This will load iptables/ip6tables rules and launch the firewall in active mode.

Run in Simulation Mode (Sniffer)
```base
sudo ./run_simulate.sh
```

This passively monitors traffic and matches rules without enforcing any verdicts.

🧰 Rule Management CLI
```bash
===== FIREWALL MENU ====:
1. Add rule
2. Show rules
3. Delete rule
4. Enable/Disable rule
5. Save rules
6. Load rules
7. Start simulation
8. Exit
```
```bash
Select mode:
1. Simulation (pcap)
2. Enforcement (NFQUEUE)
3. Main menu
0. Exit
```
